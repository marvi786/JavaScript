js was created in 1996 by netscape company
in 1997, js was submitted to ecma international to give in some name
standard name became ECMA Script
ES6:
in 2015: ECMAScript decided to make anual version of it. ES6 founded
in 2016: ES7
in 2017 : ES8
and so on.
some browsers may not support these versions so for that we have a babel
open source which is equivalent to ES5.
just to convert js file from ES6 to ES5 and it is a transpiler.

LET AND VAR:
	var is function scoped and let is block scoped.
	const is used to make the value constant so that no one can chnge it
 define a function with one variable with let and var type.
